Platonic Solids
-------------------------
An experiment created with [three.js](http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/).  
"Electrons" bound to a sphere attempt to separate themselves from one another, sometimes forming a 
platonic solid. At its present state, it's mostly a neat show of particles interacting with one another.
